# Best Practices Documentation

This directory contains research-backed best practices for TJMPaaS development.

## Purpose

Provide evidence-based guidance for:
- Architectural decisions
- Digital commerce patterns
- Operational practices
- Development processes

## Philosophy

**Critical Thinking Over Agreement**: These documents synthesize industry consensus and research to inform decisions, not to prescribe them. Apply contextually based on TJMPaaS needs.

## Document Structure

Each best practices document follows a standard structure:

1. **Context**: Why this matters for TJMPaaS
2. **Industry Consensus**: What leading practitioners recommend
3. **Research Summary**: Key findings from authoritative sources
4. **Value Proposition**: Benefits and costs/trade-offs
5. **Recommendations**: How to apply to TJMPaaS
6. **References**: Sources consulted

## Index

See [BEST-PRACTICES-GUIDE.md](../BEST-PRACTICES-GUIDE.md) for complete index and research topics.

## Status

Documents in this directory are marked with status:
- **Draft**: Initial research, not yet reviewed
- **Active**: Reviewed and approved, actively applied
- **Evolving**: Being updated based on new findings
- **Archived**: Superseded or no longer relevant

## How to Use

1. **Before decisions**: Review relevant best practices
2. **During design**: Reference patterns and anti-patterns
3. **During implementation**: Apply recommendations contextually
4. **During retrospectives**: Update based on lessons learned

## Contributing

When creating a new best practices document:

1. Research thoroughly using authoritative sources
2. Use template from BEST-PRACTICES-GUIDE.md
3. Add entry to guide index
4. Cross-reference from relevant ADRs/PDRs

## Integration with Governance

- **Best Practices** → Inform decisions with research
- **ADRs** → Make architectural decisions (may cite best practices)
- **PDRs** → Define processes (may cite best practices)
- **Service Canvas** → Document how services apply practices

## Current Topics

No documents yet. Topics will be added as research is conducted.

See BEST-PRACTICES-GUIDE.md for suggested research priorities.

## Maintenance

- Quarterly review for outdated information
- Update when industry consensus shifts
- Incorporate TJMPaaS production lessons learned
